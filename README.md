# assimetrical-multiplataform-game

The idea of this project is to create a multiplataform and assimetrical game, which one entirely different from the other.

Example:
1- A discord bot (maybe python) (market?)
2- A c++ ascii rpg 
3- A java android clicker game (item crafter?)
and so forth

The way that it's all linked up is via a database using sql.

The major goal is to learn other languages, new algorithms, group work, version control via github and other professional skills.
